# Exercise 3 - Manage Sensitive Information Types

Contoso Ltd. previously had issues with employees accidentally sending out personal information from customers when working on support tickets in the ticketing solution. To educate users in the future, a custom sensitive information type is required to identify employee IDs in emails and documents, which consist of three uppercase characters and six numbers. To lower the false positive rate, the keywords "Employee" and "IDs" will be used. In this task you will create a new custom sensitive information type, a database for EDM-based classification and a keyword dictionary.

### Task 1 – Create Custom Sensitive Information Types

In this exercise, you will use the Security & Compliance Center PowerShell module to create a new custom sensitive information type that recognizes the pattern of employee IDs near the keywords "Employee" and "ID".

1. You should still be logged into your Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account.

2. In **Microsoft Edge**, navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com** and log into the Compliance Center as sign in as sign in as JoniS@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider).  Joni's password should be provided by your lab hosting provider.

3. Select **Data classification** from the left pane.

4. If a **What is data classification?** message is displayed, select **Close** and select **Sensitive info types** from the top pane.  Hint: If **Sensitive info types** don't appear in the compliance center then it's possible Joni's permissions update to Compliance Admin in the earlier lab has not updated in your browser yet.  You may have to sign-out and sign-in again as JoniS.

5. Select **+ Create sensitive info type** to open the wizard for a new sensitive information type.

6. On the **Name your sensitive info type** page, type *Contoso Employee IDs* into **Name**.

7. Type *Pattern for Contoso employee IDs.* to the **Description** field and select **Next**.

8. On the **Define patterns for this sensitive info type** page, select **+ Create pattern**.
