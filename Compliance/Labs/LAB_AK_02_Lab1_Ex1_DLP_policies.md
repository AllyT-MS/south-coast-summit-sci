# Lab 2 Exercise 1 - Manage DLP Policies

You are Joni Sherman, the newly hired Compliance Administrator for Contoso Ltd. tasked to configure the company's Microsoft 365 tenant for data loss prevention. Contoso Ltd. is a company that offers driving instruction in the United States and you need to make sure that sensitive customer information does not leave the organization.

### Task 1 â€“ Create a DLP policy in test mode

In this exercise, you will create a Data Loss Prevention policy in the Compliance Center to protect sensitive data from being shared by users. The DLP Policy that you create will inform your users if they want to share content that contains Credit Card information and allow them to provide a justification for sending this information. The policy will be implemented in test mode because you do not want the block action to affect your users yet.

1. Log into the Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account.

2. In **Microsoft Edge**, navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com** and log into the Compliance Center as **Joni Sherman**. sign in as JoniS@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider).  Joni's password should be provided by your lab hosting provider.

3. In the **Compliance Center**, in the left navigation pane, select **Policies** and under **Data** select **Data loss prevention**.

4. In the **Data loss prevention** window select the **Policies** tab, and then select **+Create policy** to start the wizard for creating a new data loss prevention policy.

5. On the **Start with a template or create a custom policy** page, you want to select **Custom** in the left pane and **Custom policy** in the middle pane; however, by default, both these options should already be selected (if not, then select them now), select **Next**.

6. In the **Name your DLP policy** page, type *Credit Card DLP Policy* in the **Name** field and *Protect credit card numbers from being shared.* in the **Description** field. Select **Next**.

7. On the **Choose locations to apply the policy** page, select only the **Teams chat and channel messages** option to be enabled and then select **Next**.

8. On the **Define policy settings** page, the option **Create or customize advanced DLP rules** needs to be selected, which it should be by default. Select **Next**.

9. On the **Customize advanced DLP rules** page, select **+ Create rule**.

10. On the **Create rule** page, type *Credit card information* in the **Name** field.

11. Under **Conditions**, select **+ Add Condition** and then select **Content contains** from the dropdown menu.

12. On the **Create rule** page, in the new **Content contains** area, select **Add** and select **sensitive info types** from the dropdown menu.

13. On the **Sensitive info types** page, select **Credit Card Number** and select **Add**.

14. On the **Create rule** page, select **+ Add condition** and select **Content is shared from Microsoft 365** from the dropdown menu.

15. In the **Content is shared from Microsoft 365** section, select the **Only with people inside my organization** option, which should be selected by default.

16. On the **Create rule** page, select **+ Add an action** and select **Restrict access or encrypt the content in Microsoft 365 locations**.

17. Check the box in front of **Restrict access or encrypt the content in Microsoft 365 locations** and then select **Block Everyone. Only the content owner, last modifier, and site admin will continue to have access**.

18. On the **Create rule** page, in the **User Notifications** section, select the switch to put it in the **On** position.

19. On the **Create rule** page, in the **User Overrides** section, select the switch to put it in the **On** position and select the **Require a business justification to override** option.

20. In the **Incident reports** section, in the **Use this severity level in admin alerts and reports** dropdown, select **Low**.

21. In the **Incident reports** section, select the **Send an alert to admins when a rule match occurs.** switch to put it in the **On** position and review the options. The default settings will notify the user creating the policy.

22. Select **Save**, then select **Next**.

23. On the **Test or turn on the policy** page select **Test it out first** and select **Show policy tips while in test mode**.

24. Select **Next** and review the policy configuration.

25. Select **Submit** to create the policy.

### Task 2 - Modify a DLP policy

In this task, you will modify the existing DLP policy you created in the previous to also scan e-mails for Credit Card information and inform users if they want to share this content in an e-mail.

1. You should still be logged into your Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account, and you should be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Joni Sherman**. 

2. In **Microsoft Edge**, the Office 365 Compliance Center tab should still be open. If so, select it and proceed to the next step. If you closed it, then in a new tab, navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com**.

3. In the **Compliance Center**, in the left navigation pane, select **Policies** and under **Data** select **Data loss prevention**.

4. In the **Data loss prevention** window select the **Policies** tab, then select the policy named **Credit Card DLP policy** and then select **Edit policy** to open the policy wizard.

5. On the **Name your DLP policy** page, select **Next**.

6. On the **Choose locations to apply the policy** page, enable the **Exchange email** option and then select **Next** until you reach the **Review your policy and create it** page.

7. Select **Submit** to apply the change you made in the policy.

You have now modified an existing DLP policy and changed the locations it scans for content.

### Task 3 - Create a DLP policy in PowerShell

In this task, you use PowerShell to create a DLP policy to protect driver's license numbers of your customers and prevent them from being shared in Exchange. Users will be informed that they are attempting to share sensitive data and are blocked from sending the e-mail if it includes driver license numbers.

1. You should still be logged into your Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account.

2. In the start menu, select **Windows PowerShell**.

3. In the **PowerShell** window, type **Connect-IPPSSession** and then sign in as **Joni Sherman**. sign in as JoniS@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider).  Joni's password should be provided by your lab hosting provider.

4. Enter the following command into PowerShell to create a DLP policy that scans all Exchange mailboxes:

	`New-DlpCompliancePolicy -Name "Driver's License DLP Policy" -Comment "This policy blocks sharing of Driver's License Numbers." -ExchangeLocation All`

5. Enter the following command into PowerShell to add a DLP rule to the DLP policy you created in the previous step:

	`New-DlpComplianceRule -Name "Driver's License Rule" -Policy "Driver's License DLP Policy" -BlockAccess $true -ContentContainsSensitiveInformation @{Name="U.S. Driver's License Number";minCount="1";minconfidence="75"}`

6. Use the following command to review the **Driver's License DLP Policy**:

	`Get-DLPComplianceRule -Identity "Driver's License Rule"`

You have now created a DLP Policy that scans for Driver's license numbers in Exchange by using PowerShell.

### Task 4 - Activate a policy in test mode

In this task, you will activate the credit card information DLP policy you created in test mode so it enforces its protective actions.

1. You should still be logged into your Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account, and you should be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Joni Sherman**. 

2. In **Microsoft Edge**, the Office 365 Compliance Center tab should still be open. If so, select it and proceed to the next step. If you closed it, then in a new tab, navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com**.

3. In the **Compliance Center**, in the left navigation pane, select **Policies** and under **Data** select **Data loss prevention**.

4. In the **Data loss prevention** window select the **Policies** tab, and then select the policy named **Credit Card DLP policy** and then select **Edit policy** to open the policy wizard.

5. Select **Next** until you reach the **Test or turn on the policy** page and then select **Turn it on right away**.

6. Select **Next** and then **Submit** to activate the policy.

7. Once the policy is updated select **Done**.

You have successfully activated the DLP Policy. If the policy detects an attempt to share credit card information, it will now block the attempt and allow the users to provide a business justification to override the block action.

### Task 5 - Modify policy priority

After creating two DLP policies, you want to make sure that the more restrictive policy is processed at a higher priority than the less restrictive policy. For this reason, you want to move the Driver's license policy into the higher priority.

1. You should still be logged into your Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account, and you should be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Joni Sherman**. 

2. In **Microsoft Edge**, the Office 365 Compliance Center tab should still be open. If so, select it and proceed to the next step. If you closed it, then in a new tab, navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com**.

3. In the **Compliance Center**, in the left navigation pane, select **Policies** and under **Data** select **Data loss prevention**.

4. In the **Data loss prevention** window select the **Policies** tab, select the three vertical dots next to the **Driver's License DLP Policy** to open the **Actions** selection.

5. Select **Move to top**.

6. In the **Data loss prevention** window, select **Refresh** and then review the priority in the **Order** column of the policy table.

You successfully modified the priority of your DLP policies. If both policies match the same content the action of the higher priority policy will be enforced.

### Task 6 - Enable file monitoring in Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS)

You want to use file policies in Microsoft Cloud App Security to protect files in your OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online locations. Before you can create a file policy, you need to enable file monitoring so MCAS can scan files in your organization.
