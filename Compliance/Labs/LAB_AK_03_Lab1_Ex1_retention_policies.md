# Lab 3 Exercise 1 - Configure Retention Policies

In this exercise, you will assume the role of Joni Sherman, a System Administrator for Contoso Ltd. Your organization is based in Texas and wants to implement retention policies to adhere to state laws, which stipulates that records may be deleted after three years without constituting an offense. 

In order to adhere to this law your organization has created a retention plan to retain all items in the organization for three years.


### Task 1 – Create company-wide Retention Policy

In this exercise you will create a company-wide retention policy, apply a retention period, and set the locations that the policy will be applied to.

1. Log into the Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account.

2. In **Microsoft Edge**, navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com** and log into the Compliance Center as **Joni Sherman** JoniS@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider).  Joni's password should be provided by your lab hosting provider.

3. In the **Compliance center**, in the left navigation pane, select **Policies** and under **Data** select **Retention**.

4. On the **Information Governance** page, in the **Retention** tab, select **+ New retention policy**.

5. On the **Name your retention policy** page, for the **Name** and **Description** enter the following information:

	- Name: Company Wide
	- Description: All locations except for teams

6. Select the **Next** button.  

7. In the **Choose locations to apply the policy** area make sure Exchange email, SharePoint sites, OneDrive accounts, and Microsoft 365 Groups are selected and then select **Next**.

8. On the **Decided if you want to retain content, delete it, or both** page, for the **Retain items for a specific period** section, enter the following information:

	- Retain items for a specific period: Three Years
	- **Start the retention period based on**: When items were last modified

9. Select the **Next** button.

10. On the **Review and finish** page, select the **Submit** button.

11. Once your policy is created, select the **Done** button.

You have successfully created a retention policy for the Exchange email, Microsoft 365 groups, OneDrive, and SharePoint sites locations. This retention policy will retain items in these locations for three years from when the item was last modified date. This policy can take up to 24 hours to be apply in your tenant, but you can proceed to the next step.

### Task 2 – Create location-based Retention Policies with Filter

You will now create a retention policy for the Teams locations. As Teams channels can contain documents, they will all be retained. Your organization has decided that a limited number of users are required to have their Team chats require a retention period.

1. You should still be logged into your Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account, and you should be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Joni Sherman**. 

2. In **Microsoft Edge**, the Office 365 Compliance center tab should still be open. If so, select it and proceed to the next step. If you closed it, then in a new tab, navigate to **https://compliance.microsoft.com**.

3. In the **Compliance center**, in the left navigation pane, select **Policies** and under **Data** select **Retention**.

4. On the **Information governance** page, in the **Retention policies** tab, select **+ New retention policy**.

5. On the **Name your retention policy** page, for the **Name** and **Description** enter the following information:

	- **Name**: Teams Retention
	- **Description**: Retention for Teams locations

6. Select the **Next** button.

7. On the **Choose locations to apply the policy** page, enter the following settings:

	- **Exchange email** location - **Status**: Disable
	- **SharePoint sites** location - **Status**: Disable
	- **OneDrive accounts** location - **Status**: Disable
	- **Office 365 groups** location - **Status**: Disable
	- **Skype for Business** location - **Status**: Disable
	- **Exchange public folders** location - **Status**: Disable
	- **Teams channel messages** location – **Status**: Enable 
	- **Teams chats location** – **Status**: Enable

8. For the Teams chat location, select the **Edit** text link in the **Included** column

9. On the **Teams chats** pane, add the users: 
    - Adele Vance
    - Pradeep Gupta

    Note: By adding those two users the setting for included in Teams chats changed from "All teams" to just the two users you added.

10. Select the **Done** button

11. On the locations page, a notification will display: **2 users** have been added

12. Select the **Next** button.

13. On the **Decide if you want to retain content, delete it, or both** page, for the **Retain items for a specific period** section, enter the following information:

	- Retain items for a specific period: 3 Years
	- **Start the retention period based on**: When items were last modified

14. Select the **Next** button.

15. On the **Review and finish** page, select the **Submit** button.
